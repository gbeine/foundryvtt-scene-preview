# Scene Preview
### _Created by: JeansenVaars_ - [Invite me to a Coffee](#by-jeansenvaars) :) if you like this module!

Shows the GM a preview image of the scene, on moving the mouse over the scene navigation scenes.

This was formerly part of **Minimal UI** but it was ripped off for better flexibility and independence.

**Recommended with Minimal UI**
